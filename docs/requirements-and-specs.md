## 1. Product Overview

Cerefox is a **cloud-native personal knowledge backend** — it stores, indexes, and serves a single user's knowledge to any AI agent via MCP. It is designed to be:

- **Owned**: all data lives in infrastructure the user controls (Supabase or self-hosted Postgres)
- **Agent-accessible**: any AI agent (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, custom agents, OpenClaw) can search and retrieve from Cerefox via MCP, from anywhere
- **Cheap**: operates on Supabase free tier or local Docker with zero ongoing cost
- **Open source**: MIT license, designed for personal use but shareable

### 1.0 What Cerefox Is — and Is Not

**Cerefox is a knowledge indexing and retrieval backend.** It is the layer that makes your personal knowledge searchable by AI agents from anywhere, at any time. Think of it as a cloud API for your second brain.

**Cerefox is not a note-taking app.** It has no rich editor, no backlinking UI, no graph view, and no mobile app for capture. Those problems are already solved by excellent tools (Obsidian, Bear, Notion, etc.). Cerefox is designed to work *alongside* them, not replace them.

**The intended workflow:**
```
Write/organize in your preferred tool (e.g. Obsidian)
         ↓
Ingest into Cerefox (file upload, folder sync, CLI, or paste)
         ↓
Knowledge lives in Supabase — indexed, embedded, searchable
         ↓
Any AI agent, anywhere, searches via MCP
```

**Cerefox's unique position** in the ecosystem:
- The only *open source*, *self-hosted*, *MCP-native* knowledge backend
- Zero per-query cost (local embeddings, Supabase free tier)
- Owner-controlled: no vendor reads your data, no subscription required
- Agents are first-class citizens on both sides: they can read *and* write

### 1.1 Content Domains

The knowledge base supports organizing content into projects/categories. These are entirely user-defined — Cerefox ships with no hard-coded categories. The following are illustrative examples of the kinds of projects a user might create:

- **Creative Projects**: worldbuilding, fiction, publications, community content
- **Work**: professional ideas, technical notes, meeting summaries
- **Research**: topics under active investigation (AI, domain knowledge, etc.)
- **Side Projects**: ideas and projects to pick up later
- **Personal**: general thoughts, brainstorming, analysis, journaling

Projects and categories are created, renamed, and deleted by the user at any time through the web UI or CLI. There is no predefined taxonomy.

### FR-2: Content Chunking

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-2.1 | Split markdown at H1 heading boundaries | P0 |
| FR-2.2 | Within H1 sections, split at H2 boundaries | P0 |
| FR-2.3 | Fall back to H3 splitting if chunks exceed max size | P0 |
| FR-2.4 | Fall back to paragraph splitting with overlap if still too large | P1 |
| FR-2.5 | Preserve heading hierarchy path for each chunk | P0 |
| FR-2.6 | Merge very small chunks upward (below minimum size) | P1 |
| FR-2.7 | Maintain chunk ordering (chunk_index) for document reconstruction | P0 |

### FR-3: Embeddings

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-3.1 | Compute primary embeddings using a local model (no API cost) | P0 |
| FR-3.2 | Support pluggable embedder interface | P0 |
| FR-3.3 | Default embedder: all-mpnet-base-v2 (768-dim) | P0 |

| FR-3.7 | Standardize on 768-dim vectors | P0 |
| FR-3.8 | Support Vertex AI / OpenAI embedders (future, parameterized) | P2 |

### FR-4: Search & Retrieval

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-4.1 | Hybrid search: combine FTS and vector similarity | P0 |
| FR-4.2 | FTS-only search (keyword, exact match) | P0 |
| FR-4.3 | Semantic-only search (conceptual similarity) | P0 |
| FR-4.4 | Configurable semantic weight (alpha) for hybrid search | P0 |
| FR-4.5 | Document reconstruction from chunks | P0 |
| FR-4.6 | Response size limit (parameterized, default 65000 bytes) | P0 |
| FR-4.7 | Small-to-big context expansion (return sibling chunks) | P1 |
| FR-4.8 | Truncation metadata (indicate when results are cut off) | P1 |
| FR-4.9 | Filter search by project/tags/metadata | P1 |

### FR-5: MCP Integration

Cerefox exposes both **read** (search/retrieve) and **write** (ingest) capabilities via MCP. This means AI agents are first-class citizens on both sides: they can query the knowledge base, and they can contribute to it.

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-5.1 | Expose search functions as Supabase MCP tools | P0 |
| FR-5.2 | Expose document reconstruction as MCP tool | P0 |
| FR-5.3 | Expose an ingest tool (`cerefox_save_note`) so agents can write content into the knowledge base | P1 |
| FR-5.4 | Agent-authored content is tagged with standardized metadata distinguishing it from human-authored content | P1 |
| FR-5.5 | Agents can query without needing to compute embeddings server-side | P2 |
| FR-5.6 | Custom MCP server for enhanced capabilities (embedding on server, smarter context assembly) | P2 |

#### Agent Write Metadata Convention

When an agent calls `cerefox_save_note`, the following metadata fields are set automatically or by the agent:

| Field | Set by | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `source` | System | `"agent"` |
| `agent_name` | Agent (required) | `"claude-3-7-sonnet"`, `"custom-research-bot"` |
| `agent_session_id` | Agent (optional) | Session or task identifier |
| `created_by` | System | `"ai-agent"` |
| `tags` | Agent (optional) | `["summary", "research"]` |
| `confidence` | Agent (optional) | `0.9` — agent's self-assessed confidence |

This makes it easy to filter, audit, or exclude agent-authored content from searches, and to trace which agent contributed what.

### FR-6: Web Application

| FR-6.6 | Metadata management: view and edit metadata on documents | P1 |
| FR-6.7 | Ingestion status panel: track async jobs, view errors | P1 |

### FR-7: CLI

| FR-8.4 | Optional git repository backup with per-ingest commits | P2 |
| FR-8.5 | Cloud storage backup (GCS/Firebase) for cloud deployments | P2 |

### FR-9: Deployment & Operations Scripts

Scripts that a developer or operator can run to set up, update, and maintain the storage system. These live in `scripts/` and are documented in the setup guide.

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-9.1 | `scripts/db_deploy.py` — apply full schema (tables, indexes, RPCs) to a fresh Supabase/Postgres instance | P0 |
| FR-9.2 | `scripts/db_migrate.py` — apply incremental schema migrations (idempotent) | P0 |
| FR-9.3 | `scripts/db_status.py` — verify schema version, check extensions, report table stats | P0 |
| FR-9.4 | `scripts/backup_create.py` — export all documents and chunks to local markdown files | P0 |
