# Upgrading Cerefox

This guide covers upgrading an existing Cerefox installation to the latest version. All steps are idempotent and safe to re-run.

## Standard Upgrade Checklist

Run these steps every time you pull a new version:

```bash
# 1. Pull the latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Install/update Python dependencies
uv sync

# 3. Apply database migrations (skips already-applied ones)
uv run python scripts/db_migrate.py

# 4. Redeploy RPC functions (safe to re-run)
uv run python scripts/db_deploy.py

# 5. Build the web UI
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# 6. Deploy Edge Functions (if using Supabase-hosted)
#    Run from the project root (where supabase/ directory is)
npx supabase functions deploy cerefox-search
npx supabase functions deploy cerefox-ingest
npx supabase functions deploy cerefox-metadata
npx supabase functions deploy cerefox-get-document
npx supabase functions deploy cerefox-list-versions
npx supabase functions deploy cerefox-get-audit-log
npx supabase functions deploy cerefox-mcp

# 7. Restart the application
uv run uvicorn cerefox.api.app:create_app --factory --reload

# 8. (Optional) Sync project docs to Cerefox knowledge base
uv run python scripts/sync_docs.py
```

Steps 3-4 require `CEREFOX_DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file (direct Postgres connection). Steps 6 require the Supabase CLI and a linked project.

## Verifying the Upgrade

After upgrading, verify the key components:

```bash
# Check migration status
uv run python scripts/db_migrate.py --status

# Run unit tests (optional but recommended)
uv run pytest -q

# Visit the web UI
open http://localhost:8000/app/
```

## Version-Specific Notes

Most upgrades require no special steps beyond the standard checklist above. Notes below only apply when upgrading across specific version boundaries.

### Upgrading to v0.1.7+ (from any earlier version)

**Web UI replaced**: The Jinja2 + HTMX frontend was replaced with a React SPA. The web UI is now at `/app/` instead of `/`. The old root URL (`/`) shows a redirect page.

**New frontend build step**: Step 5 (`npm install && npm run build`) is required starting from v0.1.7. Earlier versions had no frontend build step.

**New dependency**: Node.js 18+ is required for building the frontend.

### Upgrading to v0.1.4+ (from v0.1.0-v0.1.3)

**Versioning schema**: Migration `0003_add_document_versions.sql` adds the `cerefox_document_versions` table and `version_id` column on `cerefox_chunks`. This is applied automatically by `db_migrate.py`.

### Upgrading to v0.1.1+ (from v0.1.0)

**Cloud-only embeddings**: Local embedders (mpnet, Ollama) were removed. If you were using a local embedder, switch to OpenAI or Fireworks AI and run `uv run cerefox reindex` to re-embed all chunks.

## AI Agent Integration After Upgrade

After deploying new Edge Functions (step 6), AI agent integrations may need reconfiguration.

### MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop)

If you are using the **remote MCP server** (Streamable HTTP via `cerefox-mcp` Edge Function), MCP clients will pick up new tools automatically on the next connection. No reconfiguration needed.

If you are still using the **local MCP server** (`cerefox mcp` via stdio), consider switching to the remote MCP server. The remote path is now the recommended default -- it supports all tools, runs server-side embedding, and works across machines. See `docs/guides/connect-agents.md` for setup instructions.

### ChatGPT Custom GPT (GPT Actions)

If you use GPT Actions pointing at the Cerefox Edge Functions, you may need to update the OpenAPI schema in the ChatGPT Custom GPT editor when new tools or parameters are added.

**Known issue**: the ChatGPT editor clears the Bearer token (anon key) every time the OpenAPI schema is saved. After editing the schema, you must re-enter the anon key in the Authentication settings. This is a ChatGPT platform limitation with no workaround.
