## Known Tasks (Not Yet Scheduled)

### Search & Ranking
- [ ] Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for hybrid search instead of linear alpha blending
- [ ] True BM25 ranking via pg_textsearch or ParadeDB extension
- [ ] Query embedding caching (avoid re-embedding repeated queries)
- [ ] Search result re-ranking with cross-encoder models
- [ ] Multi-language FTS support (beyond English tsvector config)
- [ ] Metadata-filtered search (e.g., search only within a project or tag)

### Embeddings
- [x] OpenAI embedder — `CloudEmbedder` (Phase 8, default)
- [x] Fireworks AI embedder — same class, different base_url/model (Phase 8)
- [x] Embedding migration tool — `cerefox reindex` re-embeds all chunks in-place (Phase 8)
- [ ] **Edge Function model config via Supabase secrets** — `OPENAI_MODEL` and
  `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` are currently hardcoded as TypeScript constants. Move them to
  Supabase secrets so changing the model only requires updating `.env` + `cerefox reindex`,
  without editing TypeScript or redeploying functions.
- [ ] Vertex AI text-embedding-005 embedder (add as another cloud provider)
- [ ] Benchmark: compare retrieval quality across OpenAI vs Fireworks embedders on real data
- [ ] Matryoshka/PCA dimensionality reduction for models that don't output 768-dim

### Ingestion
- [ ] **Bug: rollback document insert if embedding/chunk-insert fails** — currently if the pipeline crashes after inserting the document row but before inserting chunks, the document exists with no chunks and subsequent retries are silently skipped as duplicates. Fix: delete the document row on any exception after insert, or use a DB transaction.
- [ ] Support ingesting from URLs (fetch page, convert to markdown)
- [ ] Support ingesting from clipboard
- [ ] EPUB → Markdown converter
- [ ] HTML → Markdown converter (for saved web pages)
- [ ] Watch folder mode (auto-ingest new files dropped into a directory)

### Writing Layer Adapters (input sources)
These are "input adapters" — Cerefox is the backend, these tools are the authoring front-end. The integration is always one-way: writing tool → Cerefox (not the reverse).
- [ ] Obsidian vault adapter — Obsidian is the dominant markdown-first PKM tool and stores everything as plain `.md` files; Cerefox is complementary (not competing): Obsidian handles writing/organization, Cerefox handles cloud indexing and AI agent access. Implementation: `cerefox sync --source obsidian --vault ~/Documents/MyVault` does a one-shot ingest of all vault files; `cerefox watch --vault ~/Documents/MyVault` watches for changes and ingests incrementally. No Obsidian plugins needed — just plain folder access.
- [ ] Notion export adapter (parse Notion HTML/MD export format)
- [ ] Bear notes adapter (Bear uses `.md` files in iCloud; similar to Obsidian approach)
- [ ] Logseq vault adapter (Logseq stores as `.md` files with some own syntax quirks)
- [ ] Incremental re-ingestion (detect changes in a file, update only changed chunks)

### Retrieval
- [ ] **True small-to-big retrieval** — for documents above a configurable size threshold,
  return the matched chunks with N adjacent siblings (before + after) rather than the full
  document. This keeps context tight around the relevant passage and avoids diluting the
  agent's context window with unrelated sections of large documents.
  - Configurable: `CEREFOX_SMALL_TO_BIG_THRESHOLD` (doc size in chars, default e.g. 8 000)
    and `CEREFOX_CONTEXT_WINDOW` (number of sibling chunks on each side, default 1)
  - Below the threshold → current behaviour: return full reconstructed document
  - Above the threshold → return matched chunk(s) + N preceding + N following chunks,
    assembled in order with heading breadcrumbs preserved
  - Implement as a new RPC (`cerefox_expand_context`) callable from both the MCP server
    and the Edge Function search path
  - Edge Function: add `expand_context: boolean` request param (default false for back-compat)
- [ ] Retrieval chain: search → expand → summarize (multi-step RPC)
- [ ] Citation/source tracking in retrieved content
- [ ] Relevance feedback loop (mark results as relevant/irrelevant to improve ranking)

### Web UI
- [ ] Pagination for document lists — Browse project view (`/search?project_id=X` with no query) currently caps at 100 docs; add page controls or infinite-scroll when project grows large
- [ ] Metadata entry on ingest form (key/value editor or raw JSON textarea) — CLI supports --metadata already, web UI doesn't expose it
- [ ] ~~Collapse "Full content" section~~ — done: HTMX Show/Hide button, same pattern as Chunks
- [ ] **"No Project Assigned" dashboard tile** — show a virtual tile in the Projects section for documents not in any project (no row in `cerefox_document_projects`). Needs:
  - `client.get_unassigned_doc_count()` → single query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cerefox_documents d WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM cerefox_document_projects dp WHERE dp.document_id = d.id)`
  - Browse button → `/search?project_id=__none__` (sentinel value)
  - Search route: detect `project_id == "__none__"` and call a new `client.list_documents(unassigned_only=True)` that LEFT JOINs the junction table filtering `WHERE dp.project_id IS NULL`
  - The sentinel `__none__` is safe because real Supabase UUIDs are `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-…` format and can never equal a plain string
  - Template: render the tile as visually distinct from real projects (e.g., dashed border or muted color) so users can tell it's a virtual category
- [ ] Search-as-you-type with HTMX
- [ ] Chunk boundary visualization in document viewer
- [ ] Embedding similarity heatmap (visualize chunk relationships)
- [ ] Markdown editor for editing stored content
- [ ] Bulk operations (tag multiple docs, move to project, delete)
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-user future
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Health check endpoint
- [ ] Usage statistics (docs stored, searches performed, storage used)
- [ ] Database migration tool (for schema evolution)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions: lint, test, build)

### Backup & Sync
- [ ] Scheduled automatic backups
- [ ] Backup verification (compare DB state with backup)
- [ ] Export knowledge base as a zip of markdown files
- [ ] Import from backup (restore)
- [ ] Sync between local Postgres and Supabase

### MCP & Agent Integration
- [x] **Supabase Edge Functions** — `cerefox-search` and `cerefox-ingest` deployed to Supabase;
  callable over HTTPS from any HTTP client; server-side OpenAI embedding means no local model needed.
  Note: `invoke_edge_function` does NOT exist in `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase` v0.7.0.
- [x] **Built-in MCP server** (`cerefox mcp`) — local stdio MCP server using the MCP Python SDK;
  exposes `cerefox_search` and `cerefox_ingest` as named tools; reads `.env`; works with Claude
  Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code. Note: ChatGPT Desktop does NOT support local stdio MCP — use
  Custom GPT + Edge Functions for all ChatGPT access.
- [x] **ChatGPT Custom GPT (GPT Actions)** — OpenAPI spec pointing at Edge Functions; Bearer auth
  with Supabase anon key; free with ChatGPT Plus; full hybrid search from cloud ChatGPT.
- [ ] **Remote HTTP MCP server** (Cloud Run) — deploy `cerefox mcp` to Cloud Run so cloud AI
  clients (Claude.ai web, chatgpt.com direct) get full hybrid search without Edge Functions.
  This is the key enabler for universal cloud client access.
- [ ] **`cerefox-mcp` Edge Function** — implement the MCP JSON-RPC protocol over SSE /
  Streamable HTTP directly as a Supabase Edge Function. This would expose Cerefox as a
  URL-addressable MCP server to any MCP-compatible client (ChatGPT dev mode, future remote
  clients, etc.) without deploying anything beyond Supabase.
  Research needed before implementing:
  - MCP transport: SSE (older spec) vs Streamable HTTP (MCP spec 2025-03-26 and later) —
    determine which ChatGPT dev mode and other target clients actually support
  - Authentication: MCP spec recommends OAuth 2.0 for remote servers; investigate whether
    the Supabase anon key as a Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <anon-key>`) satisfies
    MCP clients or whether a proper OAuth flow is required
  - Supabase Edge Function limits (CPU time, response streaming) against MCP session lifecycle
- [ ] **OpenClaw** integration — OpenClaw (open-source AI agent) MCP config; same Path A
  approach as Cursor/Claude Code; track once the tool matures.
- [ ] Usage analytics (which tools agents call most, common query patterns)
- [ ] Perplexity — does not support MCP; no integration possible at this time.

## Ideas & Research

### Content Intelligence
- Automatic tagging via LLM (ingest a document, ask LLM to suggest tags)
- Content summarization at document level (store as metadata)
- Relationship extraction (link related documents automatically)
- Knowledge graph overlay on top of chunk/document storage
- Spaced repetition integration (surface forgotten but important notes)

### Teliboria-Specific
- World-building structured data (characters, locations, timelines)
- Cross-reference checks (consistency validation across world-building docs)
- Publication workflow integration

### UX
- Browser extension for quick capture (clip a paragraph → ingest)
- Mobile app for quick note capture
- Telegram/Slack bot for quick note input
- Voice note transcription → markdown → ingest

### Performance
- Query plan analysis for search RPCs
- Connection pooling optimization
- Lazy embedding computation (embed on first search, not on ingest)
- Batch embedding optimization (process multiple chunks in one model call)

| 2026-03-07 | No predefined project/category taxonomy | Open source project — users define their own categories |
| 2026-03-07 | Tests written alongside code (not deferred) | Prevents regression accumulation; easier to test small units |
| 2026-03-07 | Numbered SQL migration files | Idempotent, trackable schema evolution |
| 2026-03-07 | Backup as structured markdown + JSON | Human-readable, versionable, easy to inspect and restore |
| 2026-03-07 | Cerefox is a knowledge backend, not a writing tool | Authoring is solved by Obsidian/Bear/Notion; Cerefox's value is cloud indexing + MCP agent access |
| 2026-03-07 | Writing layer tools (Obsidian etc.) are input adapters, not competition | They handle capture/organization; Cerefox handles cloud retrieval — complementary, not competing |
