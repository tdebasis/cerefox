# Cerefox Implementation Plan

> **Approach**: Iterative and agile. Each phase delivers working functionality.
> Update this file as phases are completed and new work is planned.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation — Project Setup & Database

**Goal**: Runnable Python project with database schema deployed to Supabase.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | Initialize Python project (pyproject.toml, uv, ruff config) | Not Started | |
| 1.2 | Create project directory structure (src/cerefox/*) | Not Started | |
| 1.3 | Write config module (pydantic-settings, .env support) | Not Started | |
| 1.4 | Write database schema SQL (documents, chunks, projects tables) | Not Started | |
| 1.5 | Write search RPC SQL (hybrid, FTS, semantic, reconstruct) | Not Started | |
| 1.6 | Create DB client wrapper (Supabase Python client) | Not Started | |
| 1.7 | Write `scripts/db_deploy.py` — apply full schema to a fresh instance | Not Started | |
| 1.8 | Write `scripts/db_status.py` — verify schema and report table stats | Not Started | |
| 1.9 | Deploy schema to Supabase using db_deploy.py | Not Started | |
| 1.10 | Write tests for config module and DB client (unit, mocked) | Not Started | |

**Deliverable**: Schema running on Supabase, Python project builds and imports, deploy script documented.

## Phase 2: Chunking & Embeddings

**Goal**: Markdown chunking engine and pluggable embedding system.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 2.1 | Implement heading-based markdown chunker | Not Started | H1 > H2 > H3 cascade |
| 2.2 | Add chunk size management (max/min chars, paragraph fallback) | Not Started | |
| 2.3 | Implement Embedder protocol (base.py) | Not Started | |
| 2.4 | Implement all-mpnet-base-v2 embedder | Not Started | Default, 768-dim |
| 2.5 | Implement Ollama embedder | Not Started | For upgrade embeddings |
| 2.6 | Write tests for chunking: empty doc, headings only, oversized sections, no headings | Not Started | |
| 2.7 | Write tests for embedders: mock model output, verify dimension, batch handling | Not Started | |

**Deliverable**: Can parse any markdown file into heading-aware chunks with embeddings. Tests pass.

---

## Phase 3: Ingestion Pipeline & CLI

**Goal**: End-to-end ingestion from markdown file to database, via CLI.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 3.1 | Implement ingestion pipeline (parse → chunk → embed → store) | Not Started | |
| 3.2 | Add content hash deduplication | Not Started | |
| 3.3 | Build CLI with Click (ingest command) | Not Started | |
| 3.4 | Add CLI commands: list-docs, delete-doc, list-projects | Not Started | |
| 3.5 | Add file system backup on ingest | Not Started | |
| 3.6 | Write `scripts/backup_create.py` and `scripts/backup_restore.py` | Not Started | |
| 3.7 | Write tests for pipeline: dedup logic, chunk-to-DB mapping (mocked DB) | Not Started | |
| 3.8 | Integration test: ingest a real MD file into Supabase | Not Started | `@pytest.mark.integration` |

**Deliverable**: `cerefox ingest my-notes.md --project "creative projects"` works end-to-end. Backup scripts documented.

---

## Phase 4: Search & Retrieval

**Goal**: Working search RPCs and retrieval logic.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 4.1 | Deploy search RPCs to Supabase | Not Started | |
| 4.2 | Implement Python search client (wraps RPC calls) | Not Started | |
| 4.3 | Add CLI search command | Not Started | |
| 4.4 | Implement response size management (truncation, metadata) | Not Started | |
| 4.5 | Write tests for search client: response assembly, size truncation, metadata | Not Started | |
| 4.6 | Integration test: search with real ingested content | Not Started | `@pytest.mark.integration` |
| 4.7 | Connect via Supabase MCP and verify agent access | Not Started | |

**Deliverable**: Agents can search Cerefox via MCP. CLI search works. Unit tests pass.

---

## Phase 5: Web Application (Basic)

**Goal**: Local web UI for browsing knowledge and ingesting content.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 5.1 | FastAPI app skeleton with Jinja2 + HTMX | Not Started | |
| 5.2 | Dashboard page (doc count, recent docs, projects) | Not Started | |
| 5.3 | Knowledge browser page (search, filter by project/tags) | Not Started | |
| 5.4 | Document viewer page (reconstructed doc with chunk boundaries) | Not Started | |
| 5.5 | Ingest page (upload MD files, paste content) | Not Started | |
| 5.6 | Project management page (CRUD projects) | Not Started | |

**Deliverable**: Usable web UI for managing the knowledge base locally.

---

## Phase 6: Enhanced Features

**Goal**: Production-quality features for daily use.

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 6.1 | PDF → Markdown converter | Not Started | |
| 6.2 | DOCX → Markdown converter | Not Started | |
| 6.3 | Small-to-big context expansion RPC | Not Started | |
| 6.4 | Async ingestion with status tracking | Not Started | |
| 6.5 | Ingestion error UI (status panel, retry) | Not Started | |
| 6.6 | Metadata schema management (define custom fields) | Not Started | |
| 6.7 | Batch ingestion (directory of files) | Not Started | |
| 6.8 | Git backup integration | Not Started | |

**Deliverable**: Robust ingestion pipeline with multiple input formats.
