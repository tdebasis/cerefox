Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — all `v0.x` releases may include breaking changes.

---

## [v0.1.11.1] -- 2026-03-29

Soft delete with trash bin, restore, and purge.

### Added
- **Soft delete**: "Delete" now sets `deleted_at` instead of CASCADE DELETE. Documents remain in the database (with all chunks and versions) but are excluded from search.
- **Trash page** (`/app/trash`): lists soft-deleted documents with Restore and Purge buttons. Purge has two-step confirmation.
- **Restore**: `cerefox_restore_document` RPC clears `deleted_at`. Document returns to search and dashboard immediately.
- **Purge**: `cerefox_purge_document` RPC does permanent CASCADE DELETE. Only works on already soft-deleted docs.
- **Document detail banner**: red "Deleted" indicator with Restore and Permanently Delete buttons when viewing a soft-deleted document.
- **`'restore'` audit operation**: new operation type in the audit log CHECK constraint. Existing entries that incorrectly used `'unarchive'` for restore are auto-corrected by migration 0009.
- Database migrations `0008_soft_delete.sql` and `0009_audit_log_restore_operation.sql`.

### Changed
- `cerefox_delete_document` RPC now soft-deletes (was CASCADE DELETE).
- All search RPCs (hybrid, fts, semantic) filter `d.deleted_at IS NULL`.
- `list_documents()` in Python client excludes soft-deleted docs.
- REST API: new endpoints `POST /documents/{id}/restore`, `DELETE /documents/{id}/purge`, `GET /documents/trash`.

---

## [v0.1.11] -- 2026-03-29

Usage tracking, analytics dashboard, requestor attribution, and UX refinements (16C/16D).

### Added
- **Usage tracking**: opt-in logging of all operations (reads and writes) across all access paths. `cerefox_usage_log` table with `requestor`, `access_path`, `operation`, `query_text`, and `result_count`. Controlled via `cerefox_config` table -- no redeploy needed to toggle.
- **Analytics dashboard** at `/app/analytics`: 8 interactive visualizations (Nivo bar/pie charts, D3.js HEB charts, CSS word cloud). On-demand analysis with date range, project, and access path filters. Usage tracking toggle. CSV export.
- **Requestor attribution**: optional `requestor` parameter on all MCP read tools and all primitive Edge Functions. MCP writes use the existing `author` parameter. Multi-agent analytics now show which agent accessed which documents through which operations.
- **`cerefox-list-projects` Edge Function**: new primitive EF for GPT Actions and direct HTTP callers.
- **CLI**: `cerefox config-get` and `cerefox config-set` commands for runtime config management.
- **REST API**: 5 new endpoints (`/usage-log`, `/usage-log/export.csv`, `/usage-log/summary`, `/config/{key}` GET/PUT).
- **Metadata Search UX**: expand/collapse result cards with full metadata, content viewer (Raw/Rendered toggle), and "View Document Details" link (new tab).
- Database migrations `0006_usage_log.sql` and `0007_usage_log_requestor.sql`.
- 2 new Playwright UI tests (analytics page).
- GPT Actions OpenAPI schema v1.7.0 (9 endpoints, requestor param).

### Changed
- **Charting library**: replaced `@mantine/charts` (Recharts wrapper) with Nivo (`@nivo/bar`, `@nivo/pie`). Better dark mode, tooltips, and React 19 support.
- **Word cloud**: replaced `react-d3-cloud` with CSS flex-wrap implementation (React 19 peer dep conflict).
- **`reader` renamed to `requestor`** throughout: DB column, RPCs, Python client, TypeScript, frontend. Migration 0007 handles the column rename non-destructively.
- **Usage log tracks writes**: ingest operations now logged alongside reads.
- **Local MCP server**: no longer labelled "legacy fallback" -- described as local alternative with zero Edge Function usage.
- Edge Functions: 8 -> 9 (added `cerefox-list-projects`).

---

## [v0.1.10] -- 2026-03-28

MCP consolidation (16A), metadata search, project name standardisation, and project discovery (16B). Resolves [#9](https://github.com/fstamatelopoulos/cerefox/issues/9). Inspired by [#10](https://github.com/fstamatelopoulos/cerefox/pull/10) (h/t @tdebasis).

### Added
- **`cerefox_metadata_search` RPC and MCP tool**: query documents by metadata key-value criteria without a text search term. JSONB containment filter with AND semantics, project/date filters, optional content inclusion with byte budget.
- **`cerefox_list_projects` RPC and MCP tool**: agents can discover available projects by name before filtering in other tools.
- **`cerefox-metadata-search` Edge Function**: new primitive Edge Function for GPT Actions and direct HTTP callers.
- **`project_names TEXT[]`** added to all search/retrieve RPCs: all document results now include human-readable project names alongside UUIDs.
- **Metadata Search web UI page** (`/app/metadata-search`): filter builder with key suggestions, project dropdown, date filters, include-content toggle, result cards with metadata and project name badges.
- **Project name badges** on search result cards in the existing Search page.
- **`cerefox metadata-search` CLI command** with `--filter`, `--project`, `--updated-since`, `--created-since`, `--limit`, `--include-content` options.
- **`POST /api/v1/documents/metadata-search`** REST API endpoint for the web UI.
- Database migration `0005_metadata_search.sql`.
- 10 new MCP e2e tests, 4 new Edge Function e2e tests, 6 new API e2e tests, 4 new unit tests, 2 new Playwright UI tests.

### Changed
- **`cerefox-mcp` refactored to call RPCs directly** (16A): each tool handler calls Postgres RPCs via the service-role key instead of delegating to primitive Edge Functions via `fetch()`. Halves billable Supabase Edge Function invocations per MCP tool call. Multi-file structure: `shared.ts`, `embeddings.ts`, `tools/*.ts`.
- **MCP tools: 6 -> 8** (added `cerefox_list_projects` and `cerefox_metadata_search`).
- **Edge Functions: 7 -> 8** (added `cerefox-metadata-search`).
- **Local MCP server reframed**: no longer labelled "legacy fallback". It is a local alternative with zero Edge Function usage (relevant for Supabase free-tier limits), lower latency, and offline support.
- `connect-agents.md` updated with all 8 tools, corrected architecture description, Edge Function usage comparison.
- `upgrading.md` updated with v0.1.10 breaking change notice.

### Breaking (MCP remote path only)
- **`project_id` removed from MCP tool inputs**: `cerefox_search`, `cerefox_ingest`, and `cerefox_metadata_search` now accept `project_name` (human-readable string) instead of `project_id` (UUID). Name-to-UUID resolution happens inside the tool handler. Agents passing `project_id` in MCP calls must switch to `project_name`. **Primitive Edge Functions are unchanged** -- they continue to accept `project_id UUID` for GPT Actions and direct HTTP callers.

---

## [v0.1.9.1] -- 2026-03-23

Bug fixes reported by user testing MCP integration with Claude Code.

### Fixed
- **document_id missing from MCP search results** -- `cerefox-mcp` was dropping `document_id` when formatting search results as text, making `cerefox_get_document` and `cerefox_list_versions` unreachable through MCP since agents never received the UUID
- **Intermittent embedding API failures** -- added retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 500ms/1s/2s) to all three embedding paths: Python `CloudEmbedder`, `cerefox-search` Edge Function, and `cerefox-ingest` Edge Function. Only transient errors (5xx, timeouts) are retried; client errors (4xx) fail immediately

---

## [v0.1.9] -- 2026-03-23

Single implementation principle consolidation, audit trail completion, and UI refinements.

### Added
- **`cerefox_ingest_document` RPC**: single atomic transaction for all ingestion writes (insert/update document, insert chunks, snapshot version, set review_status, create audit entry). Both Python pipeline and Edge Function now call this RPC instead of doing direct table inserts.
- **`cerefox_delete_document` RPC**: creates audit entry (preserving document title and size) before cascade-deleting the document.
- **`cerefox_get_audit_log` tool** on the local Python MCP server (was missing; already existed on remote Edge Function MCP).
- **Audit Trail section** on Document Detail page: lazy-loaded accordion showing all audit entries for the document with color-coded operation badges, author attribution, and size deltas.
- **`author` parameter** on `cerefox_ingest` MCP tool: agents can identify themselves (e.g., "Claude Code", "Cursor") instead of the default "mcp-agent".
- **Review status filter** on Search page (docs mode): filter by All / Approved / Pending Review.
- **Upgrading guide** (`docs/guides/upgrading.md`): idempotent migration checklist for users upgrading from any previous version.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` moved to repo root (GitHub community standards compliance).
- `SECURITY.md` for private vulnerability reporting.
- GPT Actions OpenAPI spec bumped to v1.5.0 (new audit log endpoint, author parameter on ingest).

### Changed
- **Single implementation principle enforced**: ingestion write path consolidated into `cerefox_ingest_document` RPC. CLAUDE.md updated with clear guidance that all new write logic goes in RPCs, not callers.
- **Review status** correctly set on new agent-created documents (`pending_review`) -- was defaulting to `approved` due to missing logic in the create path.
- Dashboard "Updated" column shows date and time (was date only).
- Quickstart guide updated for React SPA (Node.js prerequisite, frontend build step, correct URLs).

### Fixed
- **Double JSON encoding** in `ingest_document_rpc` parameters causing "cannot get array length of a scalar" error on local MCP path.
- **Stale project badges** showing raw UUIDs after project deletion -- dashboard cache now invalidated on project delete and document edit; unknown project IDs filtered from badge display.
- **Dark mode inline code** contrast -- `light-dark()` CSS function for code/pre/th backgrounds.

---

## [v0.1.8] -- 2026-03-23

Trust and governance layer: audit log, review status, version archival, and version diff viewer.

### Added
- **Immutable audit log** (`cerefox_audit_log` table) recording all write operations with author attribution (`author_type`: user or agent), size delta, description, and version references
- **`cerefox_create_audit_entry`** and **`cerefox_list_audit_entries`** RPCs (single implementation principle)
- **`cerefox-get-audit-log`** Edge Function + **`cerefox_get_audit_log`** MCP tool (7 Edge Functions, 7 MCP tools total)
- **Review status** (`approved` / `pending_review`) on documents with auto-transition: agent writes set `pending_review`, human writes set `approved`
- **Review status filter** on search page (docs mode: All / Approved / Pending Review)
- **Review status indicators** (green/yellow badges) on dashboard, search results, project documents, and document detail
- **Version archival**: `archived` flag protects individual versions from retention cleanup. Clickable toggle in version history with tooltips and unarchive confirmation
- **Version diff viewer** (unified mode) comparing any archived version against current content
- **`CEREFOX_VERSION_CLEANUP_ENABLED`** config setting (default: true). Set to false for immutable version retention
- **Author pass-through** on MCP ingest: agents can set their name via optional `author` parameter
- **Audit log browser page** (`/app/audit-log`) with operation and author filters, document titles (SQL join), color-coded badges
- `docs/guides/upgrading.md` -- idempotent migration checklist for upgrading between versions
- Database migration `0004_add_audit_log_review_status_archived.sql`

### Changed
- `cerefox_snapshot_version` RPC respects `archived` flag (skips archived versions) and `p_cleanup_enabled` parameter
- `cerefox_list_document_versions` RPC returns `archived` boolean
- `cerefox-ingest` Edge Function accepts `author` and `author_type`, creates audit entries via RPC
- `cerefox-mcp` Edge Function passes author (agent-provided or default "mcp-agent") and `author_type="agent"`
- `list_documents()` query updated to include `review_status`
- Diff viewer simplified to unified mode only (side-by-side removed due to alignment issues)

### Fixed
- Dashboard showing all documents as "Pending" when `review_status` was missing from SELECT column list

---

## [v0.1.7] -- 2026-03-22

Major web application refactor: Jinja2 + HTMX server-rendered frontend replaced with a React + TypeScript single-page application.

### Added
- **React + TypeScript SPA** at `/app/` — Mantine UI, TanStack Query, React Router, Vite build pipeline
- **18 JSON API endpoints** under `/api/v1/` — dashboard, search, documents CRUD, ingest (paste + file), projects CRUD, metadata keys, filename check
- **Markdown viewer** with Rendered/Raw toggle on document detail, edit preview, and ingest preview
- **Dark mode** — follows OS preference with manual toggle in header
- **Toast notifications** for save, delete, and project CRUD operations
- **Dedicated project documents page** (`/app/projects/:id/documents`) — clean table listing
- **Quick search** from dashboard — input field navigates to Search with query pre-filled
- **Root redirect page** at `/` for users with old bookmarks — auto-redirects to `/app/`
- `docs/specs/ui-redesign-spa-python-api.md` — detailed design document for the migration
- `docs/guides/agent-coordination.md` — multi-agent coordination patterns via Cerefox
- `docs/research/vision.md` — comprehensive vision document for Cerefox

### Changed
- **Web UI architecture**: server-rendered Jinja2 + HTMX replaced with client-side React SPA
- **Search page** renamed from "Knowledge Browser" to "Search Knowledge Base"; requires a query (project-only browse moved to dedicated page)
- **Version history** now a collapsible table with date+time and explicit download buttons (was clickable badge row)
- **Document detail** shows Created/Updated with time, not just date
- **Dashboard** stat cards use compact horizontal layout; projects shown as table with doc counts and "List" button

### Fixed
- **Broken documents from failed embedding** — ingestion now checks actual chunk count in DB, not stored field on document record; re-embeds if chunks are missing
- **Download filename** for paste-ingested docs and Unicode titles (em dash, accents)

### Removed
- Jinja2 server-side rendering routes (`routes.py`, 850 lines)
- 83 unit tests for removed Jinja2 routes (`test_routes.py`)
- `jinja2` Python dependency
- All 15 Jinja2 template files (`web/templates/`)

---

## [v0.1.6] — 2026-03-21

Metadata-filtered search, response size redesign, UI improvements, and tooling.

### Added
- **Metadata-filtered search** across all access paths — CLI, web UI, MCP, Edge Functions, GPT Actions (Iteration 13A)
- **Collapsible document results** in web UI — `<details>`/`<summary>` panels with Full/Excerpt badges replace inline truncated content
- **"Documents (full)" is now the default** search mode in the web UI
- `scripts/sync_docs.py` — batch-upload `README.md` + all `docs/**/*.md` into a Cerefox project with `--dry-run` and `--project` flags
- `docs/guides/response-limits.md` — new guide explaining the response size model
- `docs/guides/access-paths.md` — documents all three auth/access layers

### Changed
- **Response size limits redesigned** to opt-in per call (Iteration 13C): `max_bytes=None` means no truncation (web UI, CLI); MCP/Edge Function paths enforce a server ceiling (200 KB default)
- Small-to-big retrieval threshold lowered from 40,000 → 20,000 chars
- `CEREFOX_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` now only applies to MCP and Edge Function paths; web UI and CLI are unlimited

### Fixed
- **Download 500 error** — `UnicodeEncodeError` when document titles contain em dashes or other non-ASCII characters; titles are now sanitized to ASCII-safe filenames
- Paste-ingested documents now use their title (not generic "document") as download filename
- Versioned downloads include `v<N> - <date>` suffix in the filename
- E2e test suite aligned with documented use cases (`e2e-use-cases.md` rewritten)

---

## [v0.1.5] — 2026-03-20

Small-to-big retrieval and access-paths documentation.

### Added
- **Small-to-big retrieval** (Iteration 12A) — Postgres RPC assembles neighbouring chunks for large documents; `is_partial` flag on results indicates whether full content or excerpts were returned
- E2e tests for small-to-big retrieval
- `docs/guides/access-paths.md` — comprehensive guide to all credential layers and integration paths

### Changed
- Response size limit raised from 65 KB to 200 KB
- Small-to-big params removed from Python config; configured exclusively via `rpcs.sql` SQL defaults
- `is_partial` documented in OpenAPI schema, Edge Function reference, and MCP tool description

---

## [v0.1.4] — 2026-03-19

Document versioning, two new Edge Functions, and GPT Actions schema update.

### Added
- **Implicit document versioning** — updating a document archives previous chunks with a `version_id`; partial indexes exclude archived chunks from search automatically (Iteration 12)
- `cerefox-get-document` Edge Function — retrieve full document content, with support for archived versions
- `cerefox-list-versions` Edge Function — list version history for a document
- `cerefox_get_document` and `cerefox_list_versions` MCP tools
- GPT Actions OpenAPI schema updated to v1.3.0 with versioning endpoints

### Changed
- Old migrations folded into `schema.sql` for cleaner fresh deployments

### Fixed
- Backup directory default path
- Test isolation issues

---

## [v0.1.3] — 2026-03-15

Metadata overhaul, e2e testing, and operational improvements.

### Added
- **Data-driven metadata discovery** — replaced static key registry with `cerefox_list_metadata_keys` RPC that introspects actual JSONB metadata across all documents
- `cerefox-metadata` Edge Function for metadata key listing
- **E2e test suite** — API tests against live Supabase + Playwright UI tests against local web app
- Inline two-step confirmation on destructive UI actions (replaces `window.confirm`)
- `cerefox-mcp` Edge Function — Streamable HTTP MCP adapter; promoted as recommended remote access path
- Local-time date display in dashboard and document detail views
- Cerefox Decision Log convention added to `CLAUDE.md`

### Changed
- License changed from MIT to Apache 2.0
- Adopted lightweight GitHub Flow (branch model documented in `CLAUDE.md`)
- Greedy section accumulation for chunking — sections accumulate until adding the next would exceed `max_chunk_chars`

### Fixed
- `cerefox-mcp` returning empty content for search results
- Supergateway auth flag in Claude Desktop config example
- Stale embedder default and removed unused `OVERLAP_CHARS` config
- H1 hard-boundary removed; cross-path content hash inconsistency resolved
- CRLF hash mismatch between Edge Function and Python chunking paths
- ChatGPT Desktop removed from local MCP path (not supported)

---

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-03-11

Ingestion improvements and test coverage.

### Added
- **Filename-based document update** — `update_existing` flag on ingestion matches by `source_path` (file-ingested) or title (paste-ingested) and updates in-place
- Consistent response size budget across MCP and Edge Function paths
- Skip heading-based chunking for documents that fit in a single chunk
- Test coverage for `update_existing`, `check-filename`, and `update-content` flows

### Fixed
- Chunking overlap issues
- Documentation alignment

---

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-03-11

Post-launch polish.

### Added
- "Last updated" date displayed in dashboard and search/browse results
- `docs/guides/operational-cost.md` — embedding and hosting cost estimates

### Removed
- Local embedder references (mpnet, Ollama) — cloud-only going forward (OpenAI, Fireworks AI)

### Fixed
- Stale mpnet/cost references in source file comments

---

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-03-11

First complete release. All core features working end-to-end.

### Added
- **Two-table schema** — `cerefox_documents` + `cerefox_chunks` with pgvector (768-dim)
- **Hybrid search** — FTS + semantic (cosine similarity), combined via RRF in Postgres RPC
- **Heading-aware markdown chunking** — H1 → H2 → H3 → paragraph fallback
- **Cloud embeddings** — OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (default) and Fireworks AI
- **Ingestion pipeline** — markdown documents chunked, embedded, and stored
- **CLI** (`cerefox` command) — `ingest`, `search`, `reindex`, `backup`, `restore`
- **Web UI** — FastAPI + Jinja2 + HTMX; dashboard, search, browse, document detail, ingest
- **Built-in MCP server** (`cerefox mcp`) — stdio transport for local AI agent integration
- **Edge Functions** — `cerefox-search`, `cerefox-ingest` deployed to Supabase
- **Backup/restore** — file-system backup with optional git integration
- `docs/` — requirements, solution design, implementation plan, configuration guide, quickstart, setup guides
- `scripts/db_deploy.py` and `scripts/db_migrate.py` for schema deployment

---

## Pre-release — 2026-03-07 to 2026-03-10

Initial project scaffolding, documentation structure, and phased implementation of core modules (database client, chunking, embeddings, ingestion, retrieval, CLI, web UI, backup). Not tagged.
